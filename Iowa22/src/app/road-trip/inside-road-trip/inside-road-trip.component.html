<p>inside-road-trip works!</p>


<!-- this is the nested component (the child)
& any changes to this component 
ONLY affects this component :) -->

<!-- if we want inside-road-trip to have different styling, 
we need to add code to inside-road-trip.component.css 
to override the PARENT (road-trip)  -->
